My mathematical research lies at the intersection of the the areas known as number theory and algebraic geometry. Generally, speaking number theory studies properties of numbers, and algebraic geometry studies systems of polynomials. One longstanding problem that can be understood using both these areas of math is the enumeration of all Pythagorean triples, that is triples (x,y,z) of integers with the property that <img src="eqn.gif">



are questions such as: what are all the possible values of x,y, and z
