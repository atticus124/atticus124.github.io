My mathematical research lies at the intersection of the the areas known as algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry.

Generally, speaking algebraic number theory studies the behavior of integers to polynomiails. For instance one question we may ask is are there integers x,y, and z such that <img src = "./eqn.png">. In general it is very difficult (even undecidable!) to know whether there are integers so that a given polynomial equation is saisfied.


Algebraic geometry, on the other hand, studies attaches geometric spaces to systems of polynomials as means of understanding and studying them. When we combine algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory, purely  geometric considerations from algebraic geometry can give a lot of insight about the integer solutions of polynomial equations.

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
